# Lab Report 1
*The file system used is lecture one file directory cloned from "https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f23/lecture1"*

The root directory is Lecture1. It contains Hello.class, Hello.java, README, and the messages directory.
The messages directory contains en-us.txt, es-mx.txt, fr-ch.txt, and zh-cn.txt files that demonstrate 'hello world' in different languages.

## Using "cd" command

- In the first command, I used the change directory command ("cd") on the home directory without giving a path for a new directory. Thus, no change happened and the terminal remained in the same directory.
- In the second command, I used the change directory command ("cd") to move from the home directory to the messages directory. Therefore, the terminal changed the current working directory to the messages directory _[user@sahara ~/lecture1/messages]$_
